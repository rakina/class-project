		<h1> OUR STORY. </h1>
		<p>
			Aperture Fixtures was founded by Cave Johnson as a <b>shower curtain manufacturer</b>. The name "Aperture Fixtures" was chosen to make the curtains appear more hygienic. <br>
			After making billions in the shower curtain industry, Cave Johnson turned into <b>science.</b> We gather the best researchers in the world in the hope of advancing science, for the good all of us. <br>

				<h2>We are currently doing research and testing for our three main projects: </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							The Heimlich Counter-Maneuver, A reliable technique for interrupting the life-saving Heimlich Maneuver.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The Take-A-Wish Foundation, A charitable organization that will purchase wishes from the parents of terminally ill children and redistribute them to wish-deprived but otherwise healthy adults.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The 'Portal' project - As described by Johnson when it was first laid out: "Some kind of rip in the fabric of space... That would... Well, it'd be like, I don't know, something that would help with the shower curtains I guess. I haven't worked this idea out as much as the wish-taking one."
